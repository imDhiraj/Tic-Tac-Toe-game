# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**A Classic Game of Tic-Tac-Toe**

This C++ Tic-Tac-Toe game is built using Embarcadero C++ Builder. It's a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O). The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

**How to Play:**

1. **Run the Game:** Execute the compiled executable file.
2. **Player Turns:** Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their mark.
3. **Winning Condition:** The game checks for a win after each move.
4. **Draw Condition:** If the board fills up without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
